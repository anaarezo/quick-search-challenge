# Points of Improvement

- Create a route to Home screen.
- I was focused on finalizing the application and functionality of the feature.
- Should start the unit tests as TDD, but I ended up leaving it for the end. These made it more complex to resolve the failures.
- I started the project by making the API request using React context, and only later did I remember that I should have used Redux. I ended up wasting time there.
- Could make an accessible layout focused on WCAG if it was the project.
- Isolate environment variables, such as API URL using env.
- Isolate the rendering of the `<li>` component from the list into a new render component. Making the render component smaller, easier to test and maintain.
- Avoid nested ternaries, because is not a good practice and it makes the code harder to maintain.
